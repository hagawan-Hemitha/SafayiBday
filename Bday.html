    <h1>🎉 Happy Birthday, Safiya! 🎉</h1>
    <p>
      Hey Safiya! 🥳🎂
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Birthday to one of the most wonderful people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting! 🎉✨ From the moment we met, the time I’ve spent with you has been truly amazing. We went from being strangers to besties in no time, and it’s been such a fun and surprising journey! 😄💖
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we didn’t have endless gossips or a super-close bond in the beginning, I’m so happy that things took a turn from 2nd year onwards. Every single day with you has been a delightful surprise! 🌟 Your ability to console others in their sad moments is something I noticed from the very beginning—proof of how strong and caring you are. 💪💞
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ve always been there cheering me up during my tough times, and for that, I’ll forever be grateful. 🫂💫 You’re truly one of my nearest and dearest people in this college journey, and I can’t thank you enough for everything you’ve done for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just one small suggestion though (because I care! 😉)—don’t be lazy when it comes to studies! 📚 You have so much capability and potential to top, and I know you can do it. Let this birthday mark a fresh start for you to achieve even greater things! 🚀
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that, I just want you to know that I’ll always be there for you, as long as you remember me. 💕 The little squad we formed—Hemitha, Safiya, and Sravya—has been such a special part of my life, and it only got better when we became five with Fiza and Bhanu. 🥰 It’s always been a pleasure to have you guys as my friends, and I truly cherish every moment we’ve spent together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers to many more fun times ahead! Let’s keep making amazing memories and creating bonds that last forever. 💃🎁🎈💝
    </p>
